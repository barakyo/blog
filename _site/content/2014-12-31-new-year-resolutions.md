Well I hope I'm not too late to get my new year resolutions in. I've been thinking about this post for a while, but was only finally inspired after my last cup of coffee of 2014. In fact, this day included a lot of lasts. The last swim of the year, the last time I'd visit my brother in 2014, the last time I'd accidentally cut myself in 2014 (I hope), the last..well, I think we all get it. In all seriousness, I don't usually subscribe to the new year resolution thing, I believe that if you want to change something about your life or self, why wait? But, I also understand the nice things of having a clean slate. In addition, new year resolutions are slightly cliche, but I believe that writing them down will force some accountability. I'd like to review them a year from now and see reflect on how much I've kept to them.

Anyways, enough jibber jabber, below are my new year resolutions:

* Read more (and not programming/technical books)
* Continue to shoot (photograph) more often and update my blog with some of my favorite pictures!
* Graduate and complete my M.S. in Computer Science! My thesis is complete, I need to practice defending it and actually defend!
* Try to really help one person a week. I don't mean holding the door open or letting them in, I mean really help someone.
* Talk to/meet new people. Ideally, one new person a day. (I'll elaborate on this further down)
* Continue to swim at least 3x/week! In addition, participate in masters swimming classes as much as possible!

To elaborate on the point about talking to and meeting new people, it has to do with me noticing that when I'm somewhere, typically alone, I tend to shy off (into my phone) to not really have to interact with people I don't know. I'd like to work on breaking that kind of awkward barrier when either waiting around for a cup of coffee or something of that nature.

May everyone have a happy and safe new year! Let's leave the bad in 2014 and only take the best moments and continue them forward.
