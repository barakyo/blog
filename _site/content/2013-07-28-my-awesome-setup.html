    I&#39;ve been making the switch to tiling window managers through the use of AwesomeWM. If you&#39;re not using a tiling window manager, you should definitely give it a shot! I shouldn&#39;t take all the credit though, <a href="https://github.com/copycat-killer/awesome-copycats">Copycat Killer&#39;s</a> AwesomeWM configs are a great start and essentially what allowed me to make the switch.
