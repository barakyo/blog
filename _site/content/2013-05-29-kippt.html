    It seemed to be happening more often than usual. I&#39;d have something cool to share but no one was on messenger/IRC/Facebook/Google+/etc. What good are all these social networks if its so difficult to just share the latest JS plugin I saw on Reddit/Github? Going back over my options, I thought maybe I could just drop my friends an email, but the more I thought about it, emails can be annoying and are typically dismissed. If I&#39;m going to take the time to share something, I want someone to see it!&nbsp;I needed a good way to be able to share links,&nbsp;update those that want to see it without annoying them, and have these links be accessible anywhere. In steps Kippt. Kippt is social bookmarking taken to the next level. My coworkers and I can now share links easily right through a browser extension and can be notified based on how we want. We&#39;ve been using Kippt for about a month and a half now and its been an integral part of the way we work, learn, and share.

    If you&#39;re not on Kippt, I highly recommend getting&nbsp;on, following people (and me if you want!)
