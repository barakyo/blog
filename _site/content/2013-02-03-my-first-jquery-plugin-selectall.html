    Refactoring code has been on my mind more lately than usual. I feel that if I&#39;m not actively thinking and keeping in mind of what I&#39;m coding, that I&#39;m bound to rewrite code I&#39;ve already written elsewhere. While working on Gavel&#39;s &quot;Manage&quot; page (still thinking of a clever title for that page), I realized that I had a set of checkboxes that I needed to keep track of for both my labels tab and my events tab. I wrote some small Javascript code to handle keeping track of labels as well as select/deselect all checkboxes, but when I started the events section, I realize that I didn&#39;t want to have to rewrite all this code. A lightbulb went off in my head and rather than googling for a jQuery plugin, I decided to challenge myself and write my own, so I present <a href="https://github.com/barakyo/selectall" target="_blank">jQuery Select All</a>. The plugin will take checkboxes as an input and keep track of them in an array. An optional select/deselect all can be passed in with the allSelector parameter. I&#39;m sure this has been written already, but it was a good challenge for myself to think abstractly. Go check it out and fork me if you want!
