Wow! I can't believe it's February already! As I stated in my New Year Resolutions post, I wrote down my resolutions so that I could be held accountable for them. Reviewing my resolutions after a year seemed like I would easily lose touch/sight of them. I decided a good idea would be to review my progress month-by-month, so here it goes:

#### Read more (and not programming/technical books) ####
I believe I've been doing a good job of this! My previous post was a review on Ready Player One, which was a fantastic book. I'm still reading technical books ([Clojure In Actions](http://www.manning.com/rathore/)) As I've taking a liking to Clojure, but I'm still making time for other books as well. A close friend of mine recommended reading [Outliers: The Story of Success by Martin Gladwell](http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930). From what he's told me, the book sounds incredibly interesting and very motivational. I hope to begin reading this as soon as tomorrow night (02/02/15), so keep an eye out for that review!

#### Continue to shoot (photograph) more often and update my blog with some of my favorite pictures! ####
I've been shooting and posting my favorite pictures to my [Instagram](http://instagram.com/barakyoo), but I haven't done a good job of posting the pictures to my blog. Be ready for an influx of pictures soon. I'm not sure if I just want to have one post/picture or if I want to setup a sort of gallery. Regardless, release fast and release often, so I'll have some pictures up this week. I do have a couple of shots that I have in mind and I'd like to be able to get more pictures of activities with my friends, so I'll hopefully put those in motion this month!

#### Graduate and complete my M.S. in Computer Science! ####
I've enrolled in my final thesis class, which is a step forward towards the path of graduation. I have to proof-read my thesis and practice my defense.

#### Try to really help one person a week. ####
I don't know how much I've been sticking to this one and it's probably the thing that bothers me the most. I feel like lately my friends have been helping me out a lot lately, but I don't know if I'm recipricating that back to them or towards other people. I don't exactly have a plan for this one, but hopefully I can put something together soon.

#### Talk to/meet new people. ####
I also feel that I've been dropping the ball on this. This may partially be due to me getting a new phone (and wanting to play around with it), but also just me shying away in general.

#### Continue to swim at least 3x/week! ####
I think if there is one resolution I've excelled at, it's been this one. Since Christmas, I've been swimming about 5x/week and exercising 6x/week. I've been attending Masters workouts at least once a week. I feel that my swim game has been improving tremendously. My strokes still need a lot of work, but they're getting better! Despite my hardwork, I have a plan to improve. Masters workouts are hard for me to make since they're right in the middle of the day (12-1) and having to get there early, then eat lunch, and go back to work, I lose a big chunk of my day which is why I've only been going once a week. I plan to start attending the 6AM-7AM swim workouts, that way I can get my workout out of the way early in the morning and be available for my team/coworkers when it counts!

To summarize, the things I need to work on for the month of February:

* Read Outliers (and learn Clojure :P)
* Post my favorite pictures here
* Proofread my thesis and practice my defense
* Figure out a plan to help people
* Get off my phone when I'm out alone
* Start swimming the morning masters workouts

Accountability.

One last thing, I realized my "talk to/meet new people" and "try to really help one person a week" goals aren't [SMART goals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) which may be why they're so difficult to identify. Maybe my plan for achieving these resolutions should be to identify them as SMART goals and then execute.
