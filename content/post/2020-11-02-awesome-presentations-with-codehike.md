## Background

At work, we've been focusing on building components that are reusable and more
flexible throughout our application. Because of this, we've been focusing on
making components more composable. To really drive that point home, I gave
a small presentation using an awesome library called [Code Hike](https://github.com/code-hike/codehike).

If you haven't seen Code Hike before, you should definitely stop right here and at least
give Rodrigo Pombo's (the author of Code Hike) amazing article on
[Build Your Own React](https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/) a quick look.

While this library is great, there is one unfortunate downside, it isn't well documented
ðŸ˜ž. To help out with that though, I figured I'd write a tutorial on how to create
a presentation using Code Hike!

In this tutorial, we'll show how to setup a presentation using React and CodeHike,
which will look something like this:

![Codehike Example](/images/codehike-tutorial/codehike-example.png)

## Setup

The first thing you'll want to do is start a React project. The simplest way would
be to start with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


{{< highlight shell>}}
$ yarn create react-app codehike-tutorial
{{< / highlight >}}

From there, you'll want to install the following dependencies:
* [@code-hike/mini-browser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@code-hike/mini-browser) -
The brower component for our presentation distributed as part of @code-hike.
* [@code-hike/mini-editor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@code-hike/mini-editor) -
The editor component for our presentation.
* [theme-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/theme-ui) - A dependency required by Code Hike.
* [use-spring](https://github.com/pomber/use-spring) - A minimal library built by Rodrigo Pombo for spring animations.

{{< highlight shell>}}
$ yarn add @code-hike/mini-browser @code-hike/mini-editor theme-ui use-spring
{{< / highlight >}}

Now that we've got that all setup, we can start with writing our presentation!

## The Mini Editor

The Code Hike library ships with a few components, one of those being the Mini
Editor. The Mini Editor displays an editor-like window with the content being
the code you want to show.

To get started, lets import and render the Mini Editor. If you started with a
create-react-app application, you can simply edit the `App.js` for this tutorial.

{{< highlight jsx>}}
import { MiniEditor } from "@code-hike/mini-editor";

function App() {
  const editorStyles = { width: "600px", margin: "10px", height: "400px" };
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <MiniEditor style={editorStyles} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
{{< / highlight >}}

This renders the following Mini Editor for us:

![Mini Editor](/images/codehike-tutorial/mini-editor.png)

Not terribly exciting, but hey, it's a start ðŸ˜Š

So let's try to get this ball rolling. If you take a look at the [MiniEditor props](https://github.com/code-hike/codehike/blob/ea238cc217b63b0f52d4e625c1346e3fd9efe369/packages/mini-editor/src/mini-editor.tsx#L18-L26)
you'll see that a couple of interesting properties pop out.

Let's walk through a few of the ones we're going to use and see what they're meant for:
* `steps` - An array of [MiniEditorStep objects](https://github.com/code-hike/codehike/blob/ea238cc217b63b0f52d4e625c1346e3fd9efe369/packages/mini-editor/src/mini-editor.tsx#L9-L16) which define the different steps the MiniEditor shows.
* `progress` - The step index to render
* `backward` - A boolean indicating whether we're retracing our steps

Now that we have someone of an idea of what we want to show, let's try to render some code in our
Editor.

To do that, let's start by defining some steps as [MiniEditorStep objects](https://github.com/code-hike/codehike/blob/ea238cc217b63b0f52d4e625c1346e3fd9efe369/packages/mini-editor/src/mini-editor.tsx#L9-L16).

A `MiniEditorStep` has the following properties:
* `code` - The code we want to render as a string
* `lang` - The language of the code
* `file` - The file name to display in the tab
* `tabs` - An array of strings to display as tabs

Let's start with something simple. Let's create a `Hello` component which accepts a `name`
and renders an `h1` greeting the provided `name`:

{{< highlight jsx>}}
const Hello = ({ name }) => (<h1>Hello, {name}</h1>);
{{< / highlight >}}

Let's have MiniEdtor display this code. To do that, we'll define our first step:

{{< highlight jsx>}}
import { MiniEditor } from "@code-hike/mini-editor";

const Hello = ({ name }) => (<h1>Hello, {name}</h1>);

function App() {
  const editorStyles = { width: "600px", margin: "10px", height: "400px" };
  const editorSteps = [
    {
      code: `const Hello = ({ name }) => (<h1>Hello, {name}</h1>);`,
      file: 'Hello.jsx',
      lang: 'javascript',
    }
  ]
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <MiniEditor
        style={editorStyles}
        steps={editorSteps}
        progress={0}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

{{< / highlight >}}

We now get our code rendered in the editor:

![Mini Editor](/images/codehike-tutorial/mini-editor-hello-component.png)

Okay this is cool and we're starting to move forward. 

## MiniBrowser

Let's add a `MiniBrowser` component, which we can use to render our elements side by side with our code.

{{< highlight jsx>}}
import './App.css';
import { MiniEditor } from "@code-hike/mini-editor";
import { MiniBrowser } from "@code-hike/mini-browser";

const Hello = ({ name }) => (<h1>Hello, {name}</h1>);

function App() {
  const styles = { width: "600px", margin: "10px", height: "400px" };
  const editorSteps = [
    {
      code: `const Hello = ({ name }) => (<h1>Hello, {name}</h1>);`,
      file: 'Hello.jsx',
      lang: 'javascript',
    }
  ]
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <MiniEditor
        style={styles}
        steps={editorSteps}
        progress={0}
      />
      <MiniBrowser style={styles} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
{{< / highlight >}}

Throwing in the `MiniBrowser` with the same styling. I also added some simple properties to
render the elements of the `.App` div side by side.

![Side by Side](/images/codehike-tutorial/side-by-side.png)

Our `MiniBrowser` accepts very similar [props](https://github.com/code-hike/codehike/blob/ea238cc217b63b0f52d4e625c1346e3fd9efe369/packages/mini-browser/src/mini-browser.tsx#L17-L26) as the MiniEditor with a slight change to the its [step type](https://github.com/code-hike/codehike/blob/ea238cc217b63b0f52d4e625c1346e3fd9efe369/packages/mini-browser/src/mini-browser.tsx#L9-L15).

Looking at the `MiniBrowserStep`, here are some of the props we'll be using:
* `url` - The url to display in the browser
* `children` -  A prop which accepts`React.Node` to be rendered inside the `MiniBrowser`.

Let's give this a shot!

{{< highlight jsx>}}
import './App.css';
import { MiniEditor } from "@code-hike/mini-editor";
import { MiniBrowser } from "@code-hike/mini-browser";

const Hello = ({ name }) => (<h1>Hello, {name}</h1>);

function App() {
  const styles = { width: "600px", margin: "10px", height: "400px" };

  const editorSteps = [
    {
      code: `const Hello = ({ name }) => (<h1>Hello, {name}</h1>);`,
      file: 'Hello.jsx',
      lang: 'javascript',
    }
  ];

  const browserSteps = [
    {
      url: 'http://localhost:8000',
      children: (
        <Hello name="m8" />
      )
    }
  ];

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <MiniEditor
        style={styles}
        steps={editorSteps}
        progress={0}
      />
      <MiniBrowser
        style={styles}
        steps={browserSteps}
        progress={0}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
{{< / highlight >}}

In the above snippet, we've made the following changes:
* Created a `browserSteps` list which has a single step.
  * The step renders uses our `Hello` component to render in the browser window.
* Updated the JSX declaring the `Hello` component to include the `steps` and `progress` props.

We can now render our code and the component side by side:
![Hello Component using h2 element](/images/codehike-tutorial/hello-m8.png)

## Adding More Steps

After some back and forth, we feel that the `h1` seems to be just a little too loud. We'd
like to tone down our greeting in certain cases. To support this use case, let's update our
`Hello` component so that it accepts a component to use when rendering the greeting.

{{< highlight jsx>}}
const Hello = ({ name, as }) => {
  const Component = as || 'h1'
  return (<Component>Hello, {name}</Component>);
};
{{< / highlight >}}

Let's render a new step showing how to use the `as` prop.

We'll start by creating a new editor step where we'll copy our `Hello` component into as a
string.


{{< highlight jsx>}}
const helloWithAsProp = `
  const Hello = ({ name, as }) => {
    const Component = as || 'h1'
    return (<Component>Hello, {name}</Component>);
  };
`;

const editorSteps = [
  {
    code: `const Hello = ({ name }) => (<h1>Hello, {name}</h1>);`,
    file: 'Hello.jsx',
    lang: 'javascript',
  },
  {
    code: helloWithAsProp,
    file: 'Hello.jsx',
    lang: 'javascript'
  }
];
{{< / highlight >}}

We'll then update our `browserSteps` to include a new step using the new prop:

{{< highlight jsx>}}
const browserSteps = [
  {
    url: 'http://localhost:8000',
    children: (
      <Hello name="m8" />
    )
  },
  {
    url: 'http://localhost:8000',
    children: (
      <Hello name="m8" as="h2" />
    )
  }
];
{{< / highlight >}}

Let's test this out by setting our `progress` value to 1.

### Transitioning between Steps

Looks like we're getting closer. Let's add a way to transition between steps. This is really
up to you as the user of this presentation. 

The first thing that I did was sync up the steps between the MiniEditor and the MiniBrowser.
Depending on how you're writing your steps, you may not have a 1:1 relationship between editor
and browser steps. Feel free to experiment with what fits your needs best here.

To start, I keep track of the `stepIndex` using the `useState` hook:

{{< highlight jsx>}}
const [stepIndex, setIndex] = React.useState(0);
{{< / highlight >}}

We can then write some pretty simple functions to go to the next and previous slides:

{{< highlight jsx>}}
const nextSlide = () => {
  const nextIndex = stepIndex + 1;
  if (nextIndex < editorSteps.length) {
    setIndex(nextIndex);
  }
};

const prevSlide = () => {
  if (stepIndex > 0) {
    setIndex(stepIndex - 1);
  }
};
{{< / highlight >}}

Nothing terribly exciting to see here.

Since I was screen sharing while giving mine, I decided I'd want to be able to transition between steps by pressing the left and right arrow keys.  Since I was putting this together rather quickly, I settled on using
[react-use-keypress](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-use-keypress).

While this library is a little obscure and I totally understand not wanting to pull in yet
another dependency. There is a nice little guide on writing your own [useKeyPress hook](https://usehooks.com/useKeyPress/).

Using `react-use-keypress` is fairly simple, we can just specify the `ArrowLeft` and `ArrowRight`
keys to listen to:

{{< highlight jsx>}}
useKeypress(["ArrowLeft", "ArrowRight"], (event) => {
  if (event.key === "ArrowLeft") {
    prevSlide();
  } else {
    nextSlide();
  }
});
{{< / highlight >}}

We can now pass our `stepIndex` to as the `progress` prop to our `MiniEditor` and `MiniBrowser`
this should allow us to use the left and right arrow keys to go through steps.

If you give this a shot, you'll notice that while our steps do change, we don't get any
of the fancy animations (which I'm sure woo'd us when we saw Rodrigo's blog). This is because
the animations are handled by making a progression of our steps.

To help with that, Rodrigo has implemented yet another library, called `use-spring`.
We can use the `useSpring` hook which accepts a number and a configuration object
which we can tweak to adjust how our animations render.

Given that I'm not very clever, I simply just [copied the settings](https://github.com/pomber/the-x-in-mdx/blob/c81e1f67fa21a4aba787dbe9da360793f347f2b0/src/cake-layout.js#L26-L31) 
from Rodrigo's "The X in MDX" presentation.

{{< highlight jsx>}}
const [progress] = useSpring(stepIndex, {
  decimals: 3,
  stiffness: 80,
  damping: 48,
  mass: 8,
});
{{< / highlight >}}

Passing the `progress` value to our components now gives us a nicely smooth transition between
steps.
